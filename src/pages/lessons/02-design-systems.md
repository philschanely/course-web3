### Design Systems

A big deal in contemporary interaction design today is the topic of Design Systems. I'm going to send you right to one of the best sources on this topic today: Invision's Design Better site. Run by the legendary Aarronn Walter (remember _Designing for Emotion_ from the UX class?), this is a fabulous resource for digital product designers and front end designers. In particular, lets dive into their book [_Design Systems Handbook_](https://www.designbetter.co/design-systems-handbook).

Skim [_Design Systems Handbook_](https://www.designbetter.co/design-systems-handbook).

<small>Read as much as you're able in detail but at least be familiar with the main concepts, methods, and process discussed in this book.</small>

For more examples of this idea and inspiration for the possibilities consult the [Design Systems Repo](https://designsystemsrep) for a collection of official design systems for brands such as Salesforce, Audi and Apple.
