### How to Use InVision

InVision is a web-based tool for creating prototype mockups of websites. You essentially design screen mockups using other software, upload those screens to InVision, and then add hotspots and transitions in order to simulate how the site or application should work. The result is a prototype that you can review with users in user testing, discuss with clients, and collaborate on with colleagues.

In our courses we use InVision for design review, critique, and feedback.

### Getting Started with InVision

1. **Create and account**

  University students can create an account with InVision for free using information provided by your professor that should include an access code.

  Your student account will remain active until 6 months after graduation and allows you unlimited projects in the meantime.

2. **Learn InVision**

  After creating an account with InVision you can log in and learn more about how to use the tool.

  InVision also created [an introductory video specifically for students](https://invisionapp.wistia.com/medias/5daefdvykt).

3. **Use InVision with Sketch**

  InVision built a very neat plugin for Sketch and other tools called Craft. This enables some very helpful features and the ability to synchronize screens in a project straight from art boards in Sketch. [Learn more »](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft)

4. **Use InVision for Design Feedback and Revisions**

  As we will be using the Craft plugin to synchronize design comps from Sketch to a project in InVision your professor will use InVision’s commenting feature to provide feedback. Here is an overview of the typical process:

    1. Add your professor as a collaborator on the project in InVision.
    2. Use the provided submission in CULearn to indicate that you’re ready for feedback or have completed the assignment.
    3. Your professor will use the comment and workflow tools to provide feedback on any screens.
    4. You can review feedback by clicking on the project and then the Comments tab. Your professor might also use the Workflow tool to further amplify this process, so watch for announcements about this feature.

5. **Use Inspect**

  InVision has released an excellent extended feature called Inspect that allows you to view any screen of a project uploaded from Sketch and other tools and gather technical settings from it. This includes actual CSS code, measurements, colors, and even quick access to slices exported from Sketch.

  [Learn more about Inspect »](https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/207950906-Introduction-to-Inspect)

  Note that this tool is not a substitution for good CSS practice; you should not simply copy and paste everything Inspect provides. Instead, it is a) a helpful reference you can use for measurements while building a comp and b) provides quick access to copy and paste necessary content and settings.
