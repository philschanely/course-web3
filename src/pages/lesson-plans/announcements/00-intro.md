Dear students,

***[AAA---Brief personal greeting]***

As this course is currently offered online you'll need to keep the following in mind:

* This course is an online course and follows a reliable weekly schedule. See the details on the main page of this site to be sure you're aware of the deadlines for each week/unit of the course.
* Online courses allow an increased flexibility compared to onground classes; you don't have any required class meetings to attend and you're free to work ahead of schedule at your own pace. However, you will have weekly deadlines you must meet in order to keep up with the requirements. So be sure to set aside time each week to complete these activities.
* You have access to the computer labs in the Tyler building where you can use software you will otherwise need to purchase. We recommend that you carve out regular times each week to go to the labs and complete coursework. While every unit does not require software installed in these labs, some do, and we don't want you to be caught by surprise.
* Your professor cares very much to hear from you if you have any questions or concerns. But you must take initiative to reach out for help if you need it. This is appropriate practice for what you may find in the workplace, where your employer trusts you to complete the work assigned and ask for guidance or clarification.

Best,
***[BBB---Prof name]***
