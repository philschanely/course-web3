### Overview

This project challenges you to add one or more of your previous web projects to Github and implement Sass CSS preprocessing along with related technologies. The result should be a polished site that exhibits best practices and proficiency in front end design technologies.

### Process

After completing the related lesson, following these steps:

1. Identify several potential projects and share them as a proposal to your professor. (end of week 1)
2. Use feedback from your professor to hone in on at least one project and set up a Github repository containing your starting code. Set up your local environment so that you can make changes and commit them to the repository. Share the repository link with your professor. (end of week 2)
3. Make modifications to the existing code base so as to incorporate best practices based on feedback from your professor and what you've learned in the related lesson. Commit frequently to the repository to show fluency with this technology. (end of week 3)

You are finished when a final, polished version of the project is committed to your Github repository
