The capstone course required for students in the IXD concentration is your chance to show your professors and potential employers all that you've learned in your undergraduate degree. Accordingly, this project should be substantial, and play to your strengths and interests.

Some examples of acceptable projects include:

* Redesign of an existing site. Work with the client to envision, plan, build, and deploy the site.
* Build a brand new site for a client. Likewise, work with the client from start to finish.
* Take part in a team project to build an interactive application for web browser or other device. Contribute substantially from at least a design and user experience angle, and from a programming standpoint as much as possible.

Client projects are preferred over individual or projects.

Note that building your own personal portfolio is not a substantial project. However, if you have a business or substantial or complex content side in mind, you may propose a personal site.

There is a wide range of acceptable projects, so to get the ball rolling in this course you must propose at least two substantial concepts. What you propose in this deliverable will be debriefed with your professor and refined over the coming weeks. Your proposals for this deliverable must each include the following:

* Name of the project
* Description of the project
* Client (if applicable)
* Persons involved with you and their roles (if a team project or collaborative)
* Target audience
* Schedule for completion with specific dates and deliverables identified
* Dependencies (elements you know will be challenging or will require additional help)

If you do not plan to take the Capstone course you must still propose two projects and work as if you would be completing the project. You may therefore envision a similarly scoped project for the sake of the experience of developing proposals and---in the next deliverable---the statement of work.
